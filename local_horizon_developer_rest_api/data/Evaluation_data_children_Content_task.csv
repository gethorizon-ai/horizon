"Write a text about a new piece of technology that allows researchers to see what insects see. Include information about how the tiny camera is attached to a beetle's back, how it is powered, and how researchers can control it using a smartphone.","It's hard to convince a bug to carry a video camera. But a new, extra-tiny piece of technology could let researchers see what an insect sees. Scientists built a battery-powered camera that’s so small and light, it fits on a beetle’s back. An arm on the camera pivots to see all around. Using a smartphone, a researcher can remotely control the camera to get a bug’s-eye view. "
"Write a few paragraphs about how dogs may have the ability to sense Earth's magnetic field and how this skill may help them navigate and orient themselves in the woods, based on a study that involved GPS collars and observations of hunting dogs in a forest setting","You already know your dog has a great nose. Dogs are expert sniffers that can follow another animal’s trail in the grass or track down something stinky to roll in. They may have another special power: the ability to sense Earth’s magnetic field. The magnetic field is what makes a compass needle point north. Many animals, such as pigeons and sea turtles, use a magnetic sense to travel long distances without a map. Now researchers think dogs may have this skill too. Scientists put GPS collars on 27 dogs and had their\ owners walk them in the woods. The animals were all hunting dogs. They walked without a leash and often wandered off to explore the forest on their own before returning to their owners. The researchers analyzed hundreds of walks. They saw that some dogs made a short run in a north-south direction before finding their way back to their owners. The scientists think this helps dogs orient themselves, like a person using a compass to figure out which way to go. Dogs that did a north-south run took a more direct route afterward."
"Write a few paragraphs about the color patterns and defense mechanisms of moths and butterflies, specifically focusing on how false eyes on caterpillars and adult moths can startle predators and provide a defense against being eaten. Mention specific examples such as the atlas moth and spicebush swallowtail caterpillar to illustrate your points. ","Moths and butterflies are part of the order Lepidoptera, meaning “scaly wings.” The pigments of these overlapping scales can make the difference between life and death.
Color patterns in some moths and their larvae (caterpillars) produce what’s known as the “startle response” in their predators. The most common pattern is false eyes, which caterpillars usually display on their tails and adult moths display on their wings. The atlas moth (Attacus atlas), with a wingspan of about a foot, has a forewing with a hooked tip and eyespot. When closed, its wings look like a snake. The spicebush swallowtail caterpillar (Papilio troilus L.) has a striking false eye on its rear thorax. Note the black “pupil.”
Suppose a bird is scratching around for something tasty. Suddenly, the bird sees—often out of one eye, and thus with poor depth perception—another eye “looking” back from an unknown distance. Is it harmless (in which case the bird has dinner) or harmful (in which case the bird is dinner)? The startled bird is hard-wired to flee. And the well-costumed caterpillar or moth is safe—for the moment."
"Describe the recent discovery of a new chameleon species that could potentially be the world's smallest reptile, found in the rainforests of Madagascar. Provide information about the chameleon's size, where it was found, and when it was discovered. Also, mention that the results of the scientific study were recently released.","Scientists have discovered a new chameleon that they think could be the world's smallest reptile. The chameleon, which is around the size of a sunflower seed, was found in the rainforests of Madagascar, a large island off the coast of Africa. Researchers found two members of the species - one male and one female. The chameleons were spotted during an expedition in 2012 but the results of the scientific study into them were only recently released."
"Write a paragraph about the mysteries and wonders of the human brain, including how it communicates through neurons, how patterns of brain activity can be used to control robotic limbs, and how advancements in science and technology may lead to abilities similar to telepathy in the future.","Real psychic abilities do not seem to exist. But this doesn’t make the human brain any less amazing and mysterious. It is an organ that sparks with electricity as billions of cells called neurons communicate with each other. Patterns of flashing neurons control the body and form thoughts, emotions, dreams, and more. Scientists who study the brain are beginning to understand and decipher some of these patterns. People who are paralyzed or who have lost limbs have learned to control a robotic arm or leg with their thoughts. This seems like telekinesis! But in fact, a computer system translates messages from the brain into instructions that move the arm or leg. Other researchers have collected brain activity as people watched movies. They managed to recreate blurry images of the movies from patterns in the brain activity. These braincomputer systems can’t read entire thoughts like reading a book. But in the future, it’s certainly possible that people could gain powers very similar to telepathy. If this ever happens, it will be science and technology that make it possible."
"Write about ESP (extra-sensory perception) and its history, including the work of Joseph Rhine, who conducted experiments with Zener cards to try and prove the existence of ESP. Explain that Rhine's experiments did not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of ESP and that it is not considered compatible with current scientific understanding.","ESP STANDS FOR EXTRA-SENSORY PERCEPTION, or an ability to sense or manipulate things without the help of your eyes, ears, nose, mouth, or skin. If ESP exists, it would allow people to read minds, see through walls, or move things without touching them.
A researcher named Joseph Rhine invented the term ESP. He got his PhD in botany, the study of plants. But in 1927, he abandoned that field, moved to Duke University, and began searching for scientifi c evidence of ESP. His most famous type of experiment involved a set of 25 cards with the symbols shown on the facing page. They were named Zener cards after Rhine’s colleague, Karl Zener, who came up with the designs. In a Zener card experiment, a person tries to fi gure out the symbol on a card without being able to see it.
In 1934, Rhine published a book analyzing 90,000 trials he’d done with the cards. His experiments didn’t prove ESP existed because he didn’t always follow the best methods. For example, sometimes a little bit of the design showed through a card. Rhine’s work didn’t explain how such an ability might work either. ESP is not compatible with science as we know it, and there is no indication that mysterious signals emanate from people’s heads. "
"Write a few paragraphs about DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, which is a material found in almost every living cell that contains the blueprints for building proteins. Genes are sections of DNA that determine various traits in living organisms. Scientists can change genes using gene editing tools like CRISPR to remove or insert genes. Gene editing has been used in surprising ways, such as making a squid transparent. Researchers hope that gene editing tools will improve the lives of people with genetic problems.","Inside almost every living cell is a material called DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA looks like a very long spiral staircase, with two chains that coil around each other and are connected by “rungs” made of molecules called nucleic acids. DNA contains the blueprints that a cell uses to build proteins, which do the work of keeping a living thing alive. The section of DNA that tells a cell how to build a specific protein is called a gene. Scientists use the word “genome” to describe all of a person’s DNA, including genes.
All living things—plants, animals, corn, cats, yeast, mosquitoes— have genes. Genes determine many things about a person, including hair color and eye color. They determine the color of a cat’s fur, or the number of kernels on an ear of corn. They can also influence whether or not the organism develops a certain disease.
Scientists can change genes using “gene editing,” which is also called “genome editing.” The idea is to use molecular tools to change an organism’s DNA. In the case of Captain America, a fictional type of gene editing was used to transform Steve Rogers, a short and sickly recruit, into a tall and musclebound super soldier. A real-life gene editing tool called CRISPR, for example, can snip DNA at specific places. That lets scientists remove or insert genes. CRISPR has already been used in surprising ways, like to make a squid transparent. But researchers hope that CRISPR and other gene editing tools will improve the lives of people with genetic problems."
"Write a brief paragraph about how Megaripples on Mars are still moving slowly, suggesting the planet is windier than previously believed.","In the red dirt of Mars, cameras have spotted wide waves called megaripples. The same kind of waves appear in some Earth deserts. The wind forms these megaripples. But scientists thought there wasn’t enough wind on Mars to push these big waves around, leading them to conclude they must be left over from an earlier, windier time. Now researchers have discovered that the Martian megaripples are still moving—very, very slowly. They creep along at about 4 inches (10 cm) a year. That means the red planet is breezier than we believed."
"Write two paragraphs about how Transparent ocean animals let light pass through their bodies like a window. They are delicate, drift through life alone, and rarely touch anything unless eating or being eaten.","Transparent animals let light pass through their bodies the same way it passes through a window. An amazing variety of open-ocean animals can do this: bowl-shaped jellyfish, comb jellies as long as a person, small shrimp-like arthropods, big-eyed squid, tiny larval fish, and snails that look like Christmas ornaments.
These animals typically live between the surface of the ocean and a depth of about 3,300 feet (1,000 m)— as far as most light can reach. Most of them are extremely delicate and can be damaged by a simple touch. Johnsen says these animals drift through life alone: “They never touch anything unless they’re eating it, or unless something is eating them.” "
"Write an overview of how light travels in waves and reflects off objects, allowing us to see. Sound travels as vibrations through a medium, like air or water.","Light energy travels in waves that go up and down, like waves on the ocean. These waves hit objects, whether a shirt, a mirror, or your face, and much of that light is reflected off. When you look at an object, what you see is the reflection of light from that object. Your brain translates that reflection into an image. This is how sighted people perceive and make sense of the world. Without light and the reflections of light, eyes can’t see anything.
Sound energy also travels in waves. However, this wave needs something to move through. Sound is a vibration, and when that vibration travels, it moves particles in air (or water) in a cluster and release pattern. For example, imagine that you and a friend are each holding one end of a slinky. You push your end of the slinky forward, and the coils converge together before releasing. That pulse travels down the length of the slinky."
"Write a series of statements about Dubernard's luna moth and make some of them false. Under each statement, write whether it is true or false along with any explantory text. Here are the facts to use:
A) Dubernard's luna moth does not live in South Dakota, but in parts of China, Laos, and Vietnam.
B) Their family includes about 1,500 species, such as giant silk moths, royal moths, and emperor moths, so you may need a large room for their family reunion.
C) Luna moth caterpillars do not eat night-blooming flowers, but rather leaves of trees and shrubs.
D) Luna moths do not stuff themselves as adults, as their mouthparts do not work. They live on stored fat from their caterpillar stage, as they only live for about a week.
E) Luna moths are active at night and rest during the day, so they do love the nightlife.","A) A Dubernard's luna moth might rest on Lincoln's nose at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota.
FALSE. This species of luna moth lives in parts of China, Laos, and Vietnam.
B) If you're hosting their family reunion, rent a gigantic room.
TRUE. Their family includes about 1,500 species, including giant silk moths, royal moths, and emperor moths.
C) Luna moth caterpillars eat night-blooming flowers.
FALSE. They eat leaves of trees and shrubs.
D) Luna moths stuff themselves silly as adults.
FALSE. Their mouthparts don't even work. Since they live only about a week, they live on fat they stored when they were caterpillars.
D) They love the nightlife.
TRUE. They're active at night and rest during the day."
"Write a set of bullets describing facts about dolphins. Highlight the following facts: Dolphins typically travel in pods of 5 to 20 individuals and use various vocalizations such as squawks, whistles, clicks, and squeaks. High-frequency whistles can travel up to 12 miles. Dolphins also communicate through nonverbal behaviors like tail slapping or fin rubbing, with over 30 identified behaviors. Mothers may start ""singing"" to their unborn calves as early as 2 months before giving birth.","- 5 to 20: individual dolphins in an average pod
- Over 4: types of vocalizations dolphins use (These include squawks, whis tles, clicks, and squeaks.
- 12 miles: distance high-frequency whistles can travel
- Over 30: nonverbal behaviors (for instance tail slapping or rubbing fins) dolphins use to communicate
- 2 months: time before a baby dolphin is born that a mother might start ""singing"" to her unborn calf"
"Describe the famous protest by Tommie Smith and John Carlos during the 1968 Olympic Games. Smith and Carlos, who won gold and bronze respectively in the 200 meters, made a statement by raising their fists with black gloves during the national anthem to signify Black Power and protest against racial inequality. They faced backlash, including suspension from the U.S. team and death threats. However, their gesture is now recognized as a powerful moment in sports. Peter Norman, who won silver and stood on the podium with them, supported their protest by wearing a pin for the Olympic Project for Human Rights. Norman faced criticism in Australia and was not selected for the 1972 Olympics. When Norman passed away in 2006, Smith and Carlos served as pallbearers at his funeral.","PERHAPS THE most famous protest in the history of sports took place at an event that prides itself on being free of politics: the Olympic Games. But the late 1960s were an especially turbulent time. When two U.S. sprinters, Tommie Smith and John Carlos, finished first and third, repsectively, in the 200 meters at the 1968 Games, they decided to make a statement.
As they stood on the podium for the playing of the national anthem, they were barefoot, with their exposed feet representing Black poverty. When the anthem began playing, each man raised one fist with a black glove into the air, signifying Black Power. ""It was not a gesture of hate."" Smith said. ""It was a gesture of frustration.""
The reaction against them was swift. Both men were suspended from the U.S. team and thrown out of the Olympic Village, where the athletes live during the Games. (The International Olympic Committee threatened to suspend the entire U.S. team if Smith and Carlos weren't punished.) Smith and Carlos were subjected to death threats, and one newspaper writer called them ""black-skinned storm troopers.""
More than 50 years later though, the gesture is recognized as one of the most powerful moments in sports. But there was a hitch. Carlos forgot his pair of gloves. The third man on the podium, Australia's Peter Norman (who had finished second), suggested that they split Smith's pair. (That's why Smith is raising his right fist and Carlos is raising his left.) Norman did more than that to be an ally: He wore a pin for the Olympic Project for Human Rights, the organization that planned the protest. That act caused Norman to be roundly criticized in Australia, and he wasn't picked for the 1972 Olympies despite having qualified. When Norman died in 2006, Smith and Carlos went to Australia to serve as pallbearers at his funeral."
"Wrote a brief paragraph about Kenji's recipe that transforms a simple pot of boiled beans into an exciting meal by adding flavors such as smoky sausage, onion, celery, bell pepper, and spices, a common practice in New Orleans. The recipe is popular in New Orleans where it is commonly made on Mondays with Creole flavors. It also mentions that the recipe has been tested and approved by a native Louisianan on the Kids Advisory Board.","A plain old pot of boiled beans may seem like a boring meal, but once you start adding exciting flavors to it, it’s anything but. This recipe should be familiar to anyone who has visited New Orleans, where every Monday, the Creole cooks flavor their beans with smoky sausage, onion, celery, bell pepper, and spices. You can even add hot sauce to your bowl—if you dare! This recipe tested well with Kids Advisory Board member Owen, who is a native Louisianan, so we know it’s good. "
"Write a few short paragraphs about how dolphins are similar to humans in many ways. Both are mammals, need to breathe air by swimming to the surface, and live in pods or groups to achieve tasks. Dolphins communicate with each other through vocalizations such as squawks, whistles, clicks, and squeaks, and also use nonverbal communication through body postures, jaw claps, bubble blowing, and fin caresses.","In many ways, you're just like the more than 30 species of dolphins that swim in the world's oceans and rivers. Dolphins are mammals, like you are, and must swim to the surface to breathe air. Just as you might, they team up in pods, or groups, to accomplish tasks. And they re smart.
They also talk to each other. Starting from birth, dolphins squawk, whistle, click, and squeak. ""Sometimes one dolphin will vocalize and then another will seem to answer,"" says Sara Waller, who studies bottlenose dolphins off the California coast. And sometimes members of a pod vocalize in different patterns at the same time, much like many people chattering at a party.""
And just as you gesture and change facial expressions as you talk, dolphins communicate nonverbally through body postures, jaw claps, bubble blowing, and fin caresses."
