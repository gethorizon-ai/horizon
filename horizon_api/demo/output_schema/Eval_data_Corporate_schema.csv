"Write me a set of detailed points that describe the key highlights and projections regarding companies participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs). Touch on the following points:
- ICOs lack sufficient data to assess risk and return.
- ICO-backed companies have higher risk compared to traditional venture capital.
- Blockchain infrastructure-focused ICOs perform better than application-focused ones.
- Follow-up assessment and funding shift towards venture capital expected.
- Regulatory concerns may limit investor participation in certain jurisdictions.","{""title"": ""Key takeaways and outlook"", ""content"": ""Nearly a year after the first big global wave of ICOs, there is not enough data yet to form a full perspective on the risk and return mix of this new investment medium. In prior technological revolutions, many companies failed, and it took time for those that didn\u2019t to mature into investments appropriate for a wide variety of investors.\nHowever, the early returns from ICOs are not encouraging. Compared to traditional venture capital investing, ICO-backed companies look like they offer more risk based on a number of factors including the lack of progress towards usable products.\nThe highest performing ICO investments in the last year have been mostly focused on blockchain infrastructure, while those focused on blockchain-enabled applications and business ecosystems generally have performed poorly.\nIn a year, we plan to revisit The Class of 2017 and provide an update. We also plan to issue a report later this year reconciling funding claimed by projects to the activity reflected in their respective blockchains.\nGlobally, sources of funding will likely shift away from retail investors towards entities that can understand and manage the downside risks, such as venture capital and digital asset-focused investment funds.\nRegulatory concerns will likely continue to limit participation of certain classes of investors in various jurisdictions (e.g., non-accredited investors in the US). We expect regulators in developed securities markets to proceed cautiously.""}"
"Write me an overview statement followed by detailed bullets that hits on the following points:
- Australia has handled COVID-19 well compared to other countries, supported by early actions and resilient infrastructure.
- Early measures caused changes in patterns of infrastructure use.
- Adapting domestic supply chains is crucial for resilience and productivity.
- This report is an interim report for the 2021 Australian Infrastructure Plan and complements the 2019 Audit.
- Many trends show shifts in demand, but predicting the future during uncertainty is challenging.","{""title"": ""The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the resilience and adaptability of Australia\u2019s infrastructure"", ""content"": ""The silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that to date Australia has handled the pandemic well, supported by critical infrastructure services and networks that were able to reconfigure quickly and deliver differently, and showed a resilience beyond many other OECD nations.\n- As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, Australian governments took early action, introducing travel bans, lockdowns, and border controls and supporting domestic supply chains. Communities adopted social distancing and moved to working from home. While these early measures successfully contained national case numbers, they prompted profound changes to the way people moved, consumed, and worked, changing patterns of infrastructure use.\n- Adapting domestic supply chains was a core element of our resilience and will be critical for underpinning productivity and supporting the long term move to a circular economy.\n- This report identifies the impacts of migration changes and the consequences for skills and infrastructure demand. It reviews a wide range of infrastructure trends, their geographic distribution, and their likelihood of returning to historical trend after the pandemic. It is an interim report for the 2021 Australian Infrastructure Plan, and complements the 2019 Audit.\n- The report provides an imperfect view; available data is not always up to date, so may not give a complete picture of what is an evolving story.\n- Anticipating the future during a period of uncertainty is fraught with difficulty, and many predictions made in past crises have not eventuated. Nonetheless, many of the trends show a redistribution of existing demand, a mode or channel switch, or an acceleration of an existing longer term shift.""}"
