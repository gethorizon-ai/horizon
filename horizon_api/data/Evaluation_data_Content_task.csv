"Write me a set of detailed points that describe the key highlights and projections regarding companies participating in initial coin offerings (ICOs). Touch on the following points:
- ICOs lack sufficient data to assess risk and return.
- ICO-backed companies have higher risk compared to traditional venture capital.
- Blockchain infrastructure-focused ICOs perform better than application-focused ones.
- Follow-up assessment and funding shift towards venture capital expected.
- Regulatory concerns may limit investor participation in certain jurisdictions.","Nearly a year after the first big global wave of ICOs, there is not enough data yet to form a full perspective on the risk and return mix of this new investment medium. In prior technological revolutions, many companies failed, and it took time for those that didn’t to mature into investments appropriate for a wide variety of investors.
However, the early returns from ICOs are not encouraging. Compared to traditional venture capital investing, ICO-backed companies look like they offer more risk based on a number of factors including the lack of progress towards usable products.
The highest performing ICO investments in the last year have been mostly focused on blockchain infrastructure, while those focused on blockchain-enabled applications and business ecosystems generally have performed poorly.
In a year, we plan to revisit The Class of 2017 and provide an update. We also plan to issue a report later this year reconciling funding claimed by projects to the activity reflected in their respective blockchains.
Globally, sources of funding will likely shift away from retail investors towards entities that can understand and manage the downside risks, such as venture capital and digital asset-focused investment funds.
Regulatory concerns will likely continue to limit participation of certain classes of investors in various jurisdictions (e.g., non-accredited investors in the US). We expect regulators in developed securities markets to proceed cautiously."
"Write me an overview statement followed by detailed bullets that hits on the following points:
- Australia has handled COVID-19 well compared to other countries, supported by early actions and resilient infrastructure.
- Early measures caused changes in patterns of infrastructure use.
- Adapting domestic supply chains is crucial for resilience and productivity.
- This report is an interim report for the 2021 Australian Infrastructure Plan and complements the 2019 Audit.
- Many trends show shifts in demand, but predicting the future during uncertainty is challenging.","The silver lining of the COVID-19 pandemic is that to date Australia has handled the pandemic well, supported by critical infrastructure services and networks that were able to reconfigure quickly and deliver differently, and showed a resilience beyond many other OECD nations.
- As the COVID-19 pandemic spread, Australian governments took early action, introducing travel bans, lockdowns, and border controls and supporting domestic supply chains. Communities adopted social distancing and moved to working from home. While these early measures successfully contained national case numbers, they prompted profound changes to the way people moved, consumed, and worked, changing patterns of infrastructure use.
- Adapting domestic supply chains was a core element of our resilience and will be critical for underpinning productivity and supporting the long term move to a circular economy.
- This report identifies the impacts of migration changes and the consequences for skills and infrastructure demand. It reviews a wide range of infrastructure trends, their geographic distribution, and their likelihood of returning to historical trend after the pandemic. It is an interim report for the 2021 Australian Infrastructure Plan, and complements the 2019 Audit.
- The report provides an imperfect view; available data is not always up to date, so may not give a complete picture of what is an evolving story.
- Anticipating the future during a period of uncertainty is fraught with difficulty, and many predictions made in past crises have not eventuated. Nonetheless, many of the trends show a redistribution of existing demand, a mode or channel switch, or an acceleration of an existing longer term shift. "
"Write me a detailed set of points highlighting the work my company did for the NYCHA in March 2011 to help optimize their central office support functions. NYCHA hired our company in 2011 to reshape its central office support functions for greater efficiency and effectiveness. We focused on business process improvements, IT systems enhancements, organizational structure redesign, and capabilities/cultural change. We provided key recommendations, resulting value, and projected cost savings in a document for the senior team and board.","Our company was hired by NYCHA in March 2011 to reshape its central office support functions to achieve two objectives:
- Achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness
- Free up resources to invest in the ""front-line"" of NYCHA
Our work focused on identifying four types of opportunities, which when taken together, will reshape NYCHA's operating model:
- Business process improvements
- IT systems enhancements
- Organizational structure redesign
- Capabilities and cultural change
Given the broad nature of the engagement, we are providing a document summarizing our company's work for the senior team and board. The objectives of this document are:
- Provide a summary of our company's work
- Share the key recommendations and support provided by our company
- Describe the resulting value delivered and projected cost savings
- Summarize the infrastructure, tools, and capabilities built to support successful implementation"
"Write me a set of points for a summary page that describes the work my team did with NYCHA employees to identify and implement transformation initiatives, using various approaches such as analysis, benchmarking, mapping, and interviews. Opportunities for improvement were focused on business processes, IT systems, organizational structure, and capabilities/cultural change. Key design principles were defined for NYCHA's new operating model, aiming to create a property-centric, less hierarchical organization with improved core capabilities.","We worked shoulder-to-shoulder with NYCHA employees across the organization, cooperating as a joint
team to identify, plan, and implement transformation initiatives
The joint team used several approaches to identify opportunities for improving support functions
- Detailed analysis and benchmarking of organizational structure and staffing levels to identify inefficiencies, ineffective allocation of decision rights, and other areas for improvement
- Mapping, analyzing, and benchmarking of processes and activities to identify bottle-necks
- Interviews with customers and employees to develop, test, and refine initial top-down hypotheses
- Identification of policies and regulations that could be a barrier to implementation of recommendations
The team focused on identifying four types of opportunities
- Business process improvements – streamlining processes and outsourcing non-core processes
- IT systems enhancements – making substantial improvements to IT systems and investment decision-making processes to more effectively allocate IT resources
- Organizational structure redesign – restructuring support functions from transaction-oriented departments into strategic business partners driving improvements
- Capabilities and cultural change – building capabilities to fill gaps and promote higher employee performance
To frame the development of recommendations, the team defined key design principles for NYCHA's new operating model – the overarching goal was to move NYCHA towards a more property-centric, less hierarchical organization excelling in its core capabilities"
"Write me a page with bullet points that highlight the need for long-term strategic value, efficient use of technology, best-in-class performance, and data-driven decision-making with clear accountability. Prioritize long-term solutions over quick fixes, leverage technology for process redesign, and aim for top quartile performance. Integrate performance management into processes, minimize system complexity, and align data requests with business requirements for optimal outcomes.","Design for long-term strategic value while still identifying quick wins
- Build capabilities in line with key strategic priorities
- Invest and develop for long-term solutions rather than quick fixes
Use best-in-class technology to drive process redesign not vice-versa
- Leverage technology to replace inefficient processes
- Reduce system complexity; adapt simple technology rather than develop complex, customized solutions unless necessary
- Target new data requests and information needs to business requirements and minimize additional layers
Ensure driving toward becoming a best-in-class performer with best-in-class employees
- Avoid re-inventing the wheel, leverage best practices (internal and external)
- Insist on top quartile performance in operating and customer service metrics
- Integrate performance management into processes
- Bias toward transparent, data-driven decision-making and clear accountability"

"Write me a detailed, factual page with statements and bullet points describing the following topic. During workshops, train operators expressed reluctance towards cost and revenue sharing mechanisms that would expose them to Network Rail's (NR) costs, except for Option 8 which allowed for tailored deals. Train operators cited several reasons for their discomfort with broader exposure to NR's costs and risks, including lack of confidence in regional-level financial information, concerns about NR's centralised management approach hindering innovation, and doubts about NR's responsiveness to financial incentives due to its monopoly status and governance structure as a single CLG (Company Limited by Guarantee) supplier.","During our workshops, train operators were generally not supportive of any cost and revenue sharing mechanisms which gave them exposure to NR’s costs
The one exception to this was Option 8, bespoke line-of-sight deals, where train operators were able to take on exposure to a tailored package of NR’s costs and risks on a willing buyer basis – i.e. they would be structuring the deal in a way that gives them sufficient control, or at least influence, over the costs and risks
Train operators put forward a number of reasons for why they were not comfortable taking on a broader exposure to NR’s costs and risks through a prescriptive regional cost and revenue sharing framework
- TOCs were not confident that robust financial information was currently available at a regional level. This would hamper their ability to identify opportunities and make decisions on a whole system, whole life optimisation basis. It would also expose them to changes in NR’s cost allocation policies
- NR’s highly centralised management approach would hamper TOCs’ ability to work with NR’s regional managers to innovate and implement changes locally
- Some TOCs even questioned whether NR responds to financial incentives in the same way as a normal commercial organisation given its position as a single monopoly supplier and its CLG ownership and governance structure"
