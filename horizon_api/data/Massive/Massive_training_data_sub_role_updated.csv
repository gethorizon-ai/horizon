"Associate Art Director, Boston, Market forces have reshaped our supply chains and the trading behaviors between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers. As consumers we regularly experience the results of this, but the reason this is happening is much more insidious.   Consolidation is occurring in the supply chain. A wave of mergers and acquisitions have changed the distribution market in a big way. This consolidation is causing upheaval in what used to be trusted, local-level relationships, and is forcing decisions to the corporate level.   This consolidation means limited choices, and it also means partnership decisions are being made at a corporate level, not at a local level. Combine this with partners operating in data silos, and this leads to a lot of squabbling over whose data is correct. This brings about frustration and friction into the mix, and hampers optimal customer service.   Enable believes that we should have a thriving supply chain with vibrant partner ecosystems and local representation that lets us select the products, services, and value we need. We built a platform that lets partners collaborate, agree upon and execute terms, track deal status, and identify the next best opportunity for their business. Our platform is centered on aligning goals and tracking incentives between partners. Because to solve the supply chain issues, we must change the traditional behavior. Incentives like rebates are key behavioral drivers. They unite partners in pursuit of growth and with a focus on the end customer. This is what will help companies in the supply chain succeed. They will be members of a thriving partner ecosystem where they are so well aligned and coordinated that they are a seamless extension of each other.

However, legacy metal AM has been greatly limited in its capabilities since its invention almost 30 years ago.

The company’s solution unlocks a wide breadth of design freedom and enables customers in space exploration, aviation, power generation, energy, and semiconductor to innovate the future in their respective industries. Using Velo3D, these customers can now build mission-critical metal parts that were previously impossible to manufacture. The end-to-end solution includes the Flow™ print preparation software, the Sapphire® family of printers, and the Assure™ quality control system—all of which are powered by Velo3D’s Intelligent Fusion® manufacturing process.
