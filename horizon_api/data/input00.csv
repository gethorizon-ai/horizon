The coach and client began the session by discussing how the client was feeling coming into the session. The client reported that they had been doing well, with the end of April ending one week late but ending well. They had been doing end of day updates, which had a good effect on the team, and had been taking action on messages within a few hours instead of days or weeks. The coach then asked how the last couple of weeks had been, and the client reported that they had not been able to finish a project that had been on the back burner. The coach then asked about the client's judgment of how this was bad, and the client reported that the other things that had been piling on them had contributed to completing two major projects, which was a relief.

He has given people leeway to do things and assigned people to do different things. He has also noticed that people are learning how to be careful with the budget. The client's goal is to decentralize the power and control, but he recognizes that it is also scary because it means that people can leave and do their own thing.

The client is aware of the influence he has on the cultural conditions currently.
